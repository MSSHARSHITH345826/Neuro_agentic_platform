1. Core Entities
These are the fundamental building blocks of any ontology.

Class:
Role: Abstract concepts or categories (e.g., Patient, Disease).
Significance: Define the types of things that exist in the domain, forming the schema’s backbone.

Individual:
Role: Specific instances of classes (e.g., Patient_001).
Significance: Represent real-world objects or data points.

Object Property:
Role: Relationships between two individuals/classes (e.g., hasDiagnosis).
Significance: Allow complex interconnections, enabling rich semantic queries.

Data Property:
Role: Link classes to literal values (e.g., hasAge).
Significance: Attach concrete data (strings, numbers, dates) to entities.

Annotation Property:
Role: Attach metadata (labels, comments, synonyms) to entities.
Significance: Enhance understandability and usability for humans.

SubClassOf:
Role: Declares class hierarchies (e.g., Dog is a subclass of Animal).
Significance: Supports inheritance, enabling reasoning over generalization/specialization.

EquivalentClass:
Role: States two classes are identical in their members.
Significance: Allows ontology merging and logical equivalence.

DisjointClasses:
Role: Ensures classes cannot share members.
Significance: Prevents logical inconsistencies (e.g., Male and Female as disjoint).

Domain & Range:
Role: Restrict which classes/properties can be subjects or objects of properties.
Significance: Adds semantic constraints, improving data integrity.

owl:Thing:
Role: The universal superclass (everything is an instance of owl:Thing).
Significance: Provides a root for all classes; supports open-world assumption.

owl:Nothing:
Role: Class with no instances.
Significance: Useful for expressing contradictions or impossible classes.
2. Property Characteristics
These define special behaviors and constraints on properties.

FunctionalProperty (FP):

Role: Property with at most one value per individual (e.g., hasBirthDate).
Significance: Models one-to-one relationships, supports data integrity.
InverseFunctionalProperty (IFP):

Role: Inverse property has only one subject per object (e.g., hasSSN).
Significance: Critical for identity and uniqueness.
SymmetricProperty (SYM):

Role: If A relates to B, B relates to A (e.g., isSiblingOf).
Significance: Models bidirectional relationships.
AsymmetricProperty (ASYM):

Role: If A relates to B, B cannot relate back to A (e.g., isParentOf).
Significance: Prevents cycles where not logically possible.
ReflexiveProperty (REF):

Role: Every individual relates to itself (e.g., isEqualTo).
Significance: Useful for equivalence relations.
IrreflexiveProperty (IRREF):

Role: No individual relates to itself (e.g., isParentOf).
Significance: Prevents self-relationships where illogical.
TransitiveProperty (TR):

Role: If A relates to B, and B to C, then A relates to C (e.g., ancestorOf).
Significance: Supports reasoning over hierarchies and chains.
InverseOf (INV):

Role: Defines two properties as inverses (e.g., parentOf and childOf).
Significance: Enables bidirectional inference.
3. Annotations
Metadata for documentation, usability, and external linking.

rdfs:label (Lbl):

Role: Human-readable name.
Significance: Improves understanding and display.
rdfs:comment (Cmt):

Role: Explanatory note.
Significance: Provides context.
rdfs:seeAlso (See), rdfs:isDefinedBy (Def):

Role: External references/defining resources.
Significance: Links to additional information.
owl:versionInfo (Ver):

Role: Ontology versioning.
Significance: Supports maintenance and evolution.
dc:title, dc:creator, dc:description, dc:date:

Role: Dublin Core metadata for title, author, description, and date.
Significance: Standardized, widely recognized metadata.
4. Ontology Metadata
Information about the ontology itself.

Ontology IRI:

Role: Globally unique identifier.
Significance: Ensures unambiguous reference.
Prefixes:

Role: Shortcuts for namespaces.
Significance: Improves readability and manageability.
Imports:

Role: Inclusion of external ontologies.
Significance: Promotes reuse and integration.
Version IRI:

Role: Version-specific identifier.
Significance: Enables tracking changes.
Annotations:

Role: Metadata about the ontology as a whole.
Significance: Documentation and provenance.
5. Restrictions
Logical constraints for class membership and property values.

someValuesFrom:

Role: At least one value from a specified class (existential restriction).
Significance: Ensures class membership based on property existence.
allValuesFrom:

Role: All property values must be from a specified class (universal restriction).
Significance: Enforces stricter type constraints.
hasValue:

Role: Class membership based on a property having a specific value.
Significance: Useful for defining nominal classes.
minCardinality, maxCardinality, exactCardinality:

Role: Enforce minimum, maximum, or exact numbers of property values.
Significance: Models quantitative constraints (e.g., a person must have exactly two biological parents).
