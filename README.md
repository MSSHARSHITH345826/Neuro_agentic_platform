# Neuro_agentic_platform
Modular Python package designed for building complex agent-based systems using neurostack platform. The project enforces a clear separation of concerns by organizing the codebase into distinct sub-packages, each corresponding to a critical system layer.

integration: Interfaces for connecting with external APIs, services, or platforms.
data_processing: Components for data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and preparation.
ontology: Structures and utilities for domain modeling and knowledge representation.
memory: Mechanisms for storing, retrieving, and managing persistent or transient information.
reasoning: Logic for inference, decision-making, and rule-based processing.
learning: Modules for machine learning, adaptation, and continuous improvement.
self_healing: Tools for monitoring, fault detection, and automatic recovery.
This structure promotes modularity, maintainability, and code reuse, making it easier to extend or replace individual layers as your agentic platform evolves.
