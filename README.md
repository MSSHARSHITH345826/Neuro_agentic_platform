# Neuro_agentic_platform
Modular Python package designed for building complex agent-based systems using neurostack platform. The project enforces a clear separation of concerns by organizing the codebase into distinct sub-packages, each corresponding to a critical system layer.

## Package Structure

- `integration` &mdash; Connects with external APIs, services, or platforms.
- `data_processing` &mdash; Handles data ingestion, cleaning, and transformation.
- `ontology` &mdash; Domain modeling and knowledge representation.
- `memory` &mdash; Manages storage and retrieval of information.
- `reasoning` &mdash; Implements logic, inference, and decision-making.
- `learning` &mdash; Machine learning and adaptation modules.
- `self_healing` &mdash; Monitoring, fault detection, and recovery mechanisms.
