# Agentic Platform

Agentic Platform is a modular Python package designed to help you build robust, agent-based systems. The codebase is organized into distinct sub-packages, each representing a critical layer, to encourage separation of concerns and code reuse.

## Package Structure

- `integration` &mdash; Connects with external APIs, services, or platforms.
- `data_processing` &mdash; Handles data ingestion, cleaning, and transformation.
- `ontology` &mdash; Domain modeling and knowledge representation.
- `memory` &mdash; Manages storage and retrieval of information.
- `reasoning` &mdash; Implements logic, inference, and decision-making.
- `learning` &mdash; Machine learning and adaptation modules.
- `self_healing` &mdash; Monitoring, fault detection, and recovery mechanisms.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentic_platform.git
    cd agentic_platform
    ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Explore or develop within the respective sub-packages.
